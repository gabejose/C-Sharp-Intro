# C-Sharp-Intro

This repository contains all notes I make for learning how to use C# 
(as far as the basics). Using W3Schools and Cloud Academy via QA as my reference, I can get a decent grasp on using C# and to attempt to create small projects of my own.

## Getting Started
I have been using Visual Studio Code for writing notes and example C# files (.cs)

## Pre - requisites
The following software is required in order to run the files:

* Visual Studio Code (Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

* C# Language Support on VSCode (enter 'C#' in the Extensions view)

To use .NET Core in VSCode, you will also need:

* .NET Core SDK (Download from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) - The SDK includes the Runtime

* F# extension (Ionide) on VSCode ()

## Installing

Follow instructions in pre - requisites for downloading software and extensions for VSCode

## Running the files
Clone this repo down to your computer into a folder of your choice.
